# Tariq-Saddler-Code

Hello! My name is Tariq Saddler!

I graduated from Georgia State University for Game Design/Programming in 2020.
I'm originally from Canada. I've been living near Atlanta GA in a city called Woodstock since I was 9 years old.
I'm a game designer who enjoys programming using C++ within the context of Unreal Engine 4.
I see Revature as an opportunity to earn a decent wage in a field that's not too far from what I want to do with my career, ultimately!
I love Jesus, I love video games, and I love Dominos meat-lovers pizza on a Friday night.

Games of Choice: Multiversus, Tekken 7, Guilty Gear Strive, Fortnite (no building), Hades, Risk of Rain 2
